# My Website Build

This is a rebuild of the original react/gatsy/graphql website. I decided to redo the frontend and simplify how the whole thing works. To be honest, maintaining the old one was not exactly easy because I did not fully understand the dependencies used. I was not the designer of the core components.

I decided to strive on designing a good looking website.
