# My Website Build

[Access my website here](https://seanchok.com)

This is a rebuild of the original react / gatsy / graphql website. I decided to redo the frontend and simplify how the whole thing works. To be honest, maintaining the old one was not exactly easy because I did not fully understand the dependencies used. I was not the designer of the core components.

I decided to strive on designing a good looking website.

_Full disclaimer: I'm basically the worst designer you can find, at least my friends told me so._
